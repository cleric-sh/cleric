 * This is semantically the same as referencing '../shared'.
 *
 * If we delete 'node_modules' or set this up in a single repository, this
 * form of referencing won't work.
 *
 * The @cleric/a package itself doesn't know anything about a module called
 * '@cleric/a'. However, typescript will allow us to reference it here because
 * of the monorepo setup. Typescript/node will search up the hierarchy until
 * it finds the root node_modules, where '@cleric/a' is symlinked by yarn as
